Reinforcement Learning with LLMs in Verifiable Environments

Inspired by https://github.com/willccbb/verifiers project and work like Planbenc (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10498), Zebra Logic (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01100), games such as sudoku, knight sudoku, Frozen Lake, and other puzzles which are deterministic.

First phase:
1. Deterministic and same solution
2. Simple computer-based games etc

Second Phase:
1. Simple puzzles
2. Deterministic and multiple solutions
